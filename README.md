clapping-bot
============

An Arduino-powered robot that performs [Steve Reich's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich) "Clapping Music".

What better way to pay tribute to the composer's rhymic, calculated music than to have it played by a robot?
Clapping Bot is a small box with 2 mallets. Each mallet acts as one of the performers of the piece. That's all it does.

Check out this [pretty sweet live performance of the piece by Reich himself.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhhvgdQs_h4)
